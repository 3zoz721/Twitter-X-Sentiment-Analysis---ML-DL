# Twitter-X-Sentiment-Analysis---ML-DL

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify sentiments (Negative, Neutral, Positive) from tweets related to several tech brands using both Machine Learning and Deep Learning models.

## Technologies Used
- *Languages*: Python
- *Libraries*: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, TensorFlow
- *Tools*: Jupyter Notebook, GitHub

## Workflow
1. Data loading and merging
2. Text preprocessing (cleaning, stopword removal, lemmatization)
3. TF-IDF vectorization for ML models
4. Tokenization + padding for DL models
5. Model building & evaluation:
   - ML: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, CatBoost, etc.
   - DL: LSTM, GRU
6. Accuracy comparison across all models

## Key Results
- Best ML Model: Random Forest (Accuracy = 89%)
- Best DL Model: LSTM (Accuracy = 88%)
- Clean preprocessing and proper feature engineering helped boost performance.
